Jelly-Flap
==========

This is inspired by the recently viral game 'Flappy Bird' by Dong Nguyen. I wanted to make a free (no ads or IAP) clone with a similar style to show support and hopefully inspire other indies to make games out of love. While I can never imagine what the flood of press must have felt like I do understand his decision to pull the app and I support it.

If you are unfamiliar with Flappy Bird. The game is played by tapping to propel the jellyfish upwards while gravity pulls you down. The objective is to navigate through the kelp without hitting them.

This is a universal app written for iOS 7.
